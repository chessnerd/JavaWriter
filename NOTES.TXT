Notes to Editors:

Primary Goal:
Create a simple, easy-to-use program that writes a Java program skeleton, including JavaDocs

To do:
* Write a JFrame, similar to the makeField JFrame, for making custom constructors
* Write an intelligent, generic toString() to go with the created classes

Suggestions:
* Find a way to cut down on the number of fields in the two classes
* Clean up the coding of GUI elements
* A possible idea of a branch-off: a program that auto-writes a standard five-paragraph essay

Explanations:
* Many parts of the constructor functionality already exists in the GUI classes
* The commented out lines in the constructor of the GUI are there for a future release which will include the feature of the using adding custom constructors
* The constructor functionality in the writer class uses two 2-D arrays. The first dimension is for the constructor number, the second is for the fields names and types to be used in the constructor
* The cNumField.setText("0") line in the constructor will be necessary until constructor functionality is added

Version Number Explanation:
The first number is the version number
The second number is the release number
The third number is the update number

Each class is assigned its own version number as is the program as a whole. The version of the program as a whole is found in the README.TXT file

So, if the version number was 1.25.3 that would mean that the current version is 1, the current release was numbered 25, and there have been 3 updates on that release

The version number only changes if there has been a large improvement to both the code and interface
The release number is more arbitrary than the version or update number and simply reflects how large of a change there is between the current release and the previous
The update number increases by one every time that a new update is posted

A letter may also appear after the numbers, in which case it has this meaning:
*An "a" means "alpha release"
*A "b" means "beta release"
*An "rc" means "release candidate"
